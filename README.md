# üåç Transparent Carbon Credit Platform for Disaster Resilience

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution that brings transparency and accountability to carbon credit programs! This project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create verifiable carbon credits, which are used to fund climate resilience projects in disaster-prone regions like coastal areas vulnerable to hurricanes or flood-risk zones. By leveraging blockchain, we eliminate fraud, ensure funds reach intended projects, and allow global participation in sustainable impact.

The real-world problem solved: Traditional carbon credit systems often lack transparency, leading to greenwashing, double-counting, and misallocated funds. This platform ensures every credit is traceable, projects are vetted democratically, and funding is directed to build resilience (e.g., mangrove restoration, early warning systems) in high-risk areas, helping combat climate change effects on vulnerable communities.

## ‚ú® Features

üîç Full transparency: All transactions, credit issuances, and fund disbursements are immutable and auditable on-chain.  
üí∞ Tokenized carbon credits: Mint, trade, and retire credits as SIP-010 fungible tokens.  
üèóÔ∏è Project funding: Crowdfund and allocate resources to verified resilience initiatives.  
üó≥Ô∏è Decentralized governance: Token holders vote on project approvals and fund releases.  
‚úÖ Oracle-verified milestones: External data feeds confirm project progress and carbon offsets.  
üìä Analytics dashboard: On-chain queries for impact reports and credit tracking.  
üö´ Anti-fraud mechanisms: Prevent double-spending and ensure unique project registrations.

## üõ† How It Works

This project involves 8 smart contracts written in Clarity, deployed on the Stacks blockchain. They interact seamlessly to handle credit creation, project management, funding, and governance. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **CarbonCreditToken.clar**: An SIP-010 compliant fungible token contract for representing carbon credits. Handles minting (by verified issuers), burning (retirement), and transfers.
2. **ProjectRegistry.clar**: Registers resilience projects with details like location, description, goals, and required funding. Ensures uniqueness via hashes and prevents duplicates.
3. **FundingPool.clar**: A escrow-like contract that pools carbon credit proceeds (converted to STX or stablecoins) for specific projects. Releases funds in tranches based on milestones.
4. **VerificationOracle.clar**: Integrates with external oracles (e.g., via Clarity's read-only functions) to verify real-world data, such as satellite imagery for carbon sequestration or project completion reports.
5. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Manages voting with carbon credit tokens. Token holders propose and vote on project approvals, fund allocations, and platform upgrades.
6. **UserRegistry.clar**: Registers participants (issuers, project owners, donors) with KYC-like on-chain proofs to ensure legitimacy and compliance.
7. **Marketplace.clar**: A decentralized exchange for buying/selling carbon credits, with fees directed to a resilience fund.
8. **AuditLog.clar**: Logs all key events across contracts (e.g., mints, votes, disbursements) in an immutable append-only structure for easy auditing.

**For Carbon Credit Issuers (e.g., Companies or Offset Providers)**  
- Verify your identity via UserRegistry.  
- Submit proof of offsets (e.g., via VerificationOracle).  
- Mint credits using CarbonCreditToken by providing a unique hash of your offset data.  
- Sell credits on the Marketplace to generate funds.

**For Project Owners in Disaster-Prone Regions**  
- Register your project in ProjectRegistry with details and funding needs.  
- Get community approval via GovernanceDAO votes.  
- Receive funds from FundingPool upon oracle-verified milestones (e.g., "Mangrove planted: confirmed by satellite").  
- Use AuditLog to prove transparent use of funds.

**For Donors and Investors**  
- Buy carbon credits on the Marketplace to offset emissions.  
- Stake tokens in GovernanceDAO to vote on projects.  
- Track impact via on-chain queries‚Äîe.g., call get-project-details in ProjectRegistry or view logs in AuditLog.

**For Verifiers and Auditors**  
- Use VerificationOracle to check real-world proofs.  
- Query AuditLog for a complete transaction history.  
- Call verify-credit-ownership in CarbonCreditToken to confirm legitimacy.

Getting Started: Deploy the contracts on Stacks testnet, integrate with a frontend (e.g., React with @stacks/connect), and use tools like Clarinet for testing. This setup ensures scalability, with Stacks' Bitcoin anchoring for security. Let's build a greener, more resilient world‚Äîone block at a time!
